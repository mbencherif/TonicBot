# TonicBot - LOG

## Project Description

Taking as a basis the excellent Chatterbot project, my objective in this project is to build on top of it a tool to assist foreign language learners 
through fun activities such as chatting. Currently, Chatterbot uses a machine learning algorithm to choose the most likely response for a given
utterance from the user. In that sense, it solves a classification problem, that is, a sentence will be chosen out of all the sentences that the program
has been trained on. It is not a generative model in such a way as to produce a new sentence never seen before and that would be appropriate for the
given context.

In this project, the machine learning algorithm will try to build some kind of model the context of the discussion that will the user will be engaged 
in. Then, from this model, the chatbot program will be able to generate natural sentences on its own.

### Today's Progress

- [x] Familiarisation with the code base of Chatterbot
- [x] Started to think of the potential algorithms that could be used



## Day 1: Jul 16, 2018

### Roadmap for the Day Ahead

- [ ] Review of the litterature regarding the problem of context modelisation
- [ ] Become familiar with word models in Python (e.g. [GloVe Project](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
- [ ] Read Chapter 6 - Deep Learning for Text and Sequences of the book [Deep Learning with Python](http://a.co/9EZKqrI)
